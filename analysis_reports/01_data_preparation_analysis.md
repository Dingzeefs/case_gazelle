# Data Preparation Analysis Report - Notebook 01
**Date**: September 2025  
**Analyst**: Claude Code  
**Notebook**: `/notebooks/01_dataprep.ipynb`

## Executive Summary

The data preparation phase has successfully processed and corrected critical data quality issues that were severely distorting market analysis. Most importantly, we've **fixed aggressive deduplication logic that was causing 69% data loss** and **artificially inflating Pon's market share from 19% to 44%**.

### Key Achievements:
- ✅ **Market share corrected**: From artificial 44% to realistic 19.0%
- ✅ **Multi-brand detection restored**: 0 → 1,374 multi-brand locations (66% of market)
- ✅ **Cannibalization analysis enabled**: 302 multi-Pon locations detected
- ✅ **Geographic mapping established**: 33.3% PC4-gemeente coverage
- ✅ **Demographic clustering implemented**: 5 meaningful market segments

## Data Processing Overview

### Dealers Data Processing

#### Input Data:
- **Raw dealer records**: 6,748 total relationships
- **Unique locations**: 2,080 physical dealer locations
- **Pon brand relationships**: 1,282 (19.0% true market share)
- **Non-Pon relationships**: 5,466 (81.0%)

#### Critical Fix - Deduplication Logic:
**PROBLEM**: Original logic was using aggressive deduplication:
```python
# PROBLEMATIC (caused 69% data loss):
dealers = dealers.drop_duplicates("google_place_id")
```

**SOLUTION**: Implemented proper brand relationship preservation:
```python
# CORRECTED (preserves all brand relationships):
dealers_by_location = dealers.groupby('google_place_id').agg({
    'brand_clean': lambda x: list(sorted(set(x))),  # All brands per location
    'is_pon_dealer': 'any',  # True if any Pon brand present
    # ... other aggregations
})
```

#### Results:
| Metric | Before Fix | After Fix | Impact |
|--------|------------|-----------|---------|
| **Total Records** | 2,080 | 6,748 | +225% data recovery |
| **Pon Market Share** | 43.8% | 19.0% | Realistic positioning |
| **Multi-brand Locations** | 0 | 1,374 | Cannibalization visible |
| **Multi-Pon Locations** | 0 | 302 | Internal competition detected |

### Brand Performance Analysis

#### Pon Brand Portfolio (Corrected):
| Brand | Unique Locations | Total Relationships | Avg Rating | Market Presence |

| **Cervélo** | 35 | 35 | 4.58 | 1.7% |
| **Focus** | 8 | 8 | 4.89 | 0.4% |

#### Key Brand Insights:

## Conclusion

The data preparation phase has successfully corrected fundamental data quality issues that were severely distorting strategic analysis. The **restoration of multi-brand relationship data** and **correction of market share calculations** provides a realistic foundation for board-level decision making.

**Most Critical Finding**: The Netherlands bike retail market is highly fragmented with 66% multi-brand locations, requiring a fundamentally different approach to channel strategy and brand positioning than previously assumed.

The corrected data enables accurate analysis of:
- ✅ True competitive positioning (19% vs 44% inflated share)
- ✅ Internal brand cannibalization risks (302 multi-Pon locations)  
- ✅ Geographic expansion opportunities (5 demographic clusters)
- ✅ Brand portfolio optimization (Union performance recovery)

**Next Steps**: Proceed with coverage analysis (02_coverage.ipynb) using corrected location data and demographic clusters for strategic white space identification.
